# Cross platform image editor
Image editing tool that can take photos from an available camera editing or load images to edit.

I built a cross-platform application in C++ using QT. The scope of the project was very broad so I decided to create an application for taking image from a webcam, or loading them, and then edit them. The main features of the application are:

* Adjust Brightness
* Adjust Red Contrast
* Mirror Image
* Invert Colors
* Grey Scale Image
* Undo/Redo capabilities
* Camera Capture Delay
* Email with multiple attachments
* Open/Save Image
* Size Adjust without loss of quality

Below is a video demo of the application.
